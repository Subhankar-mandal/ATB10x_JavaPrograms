    /** String: In Java, String is a type of object that can store the sequence of characters enclosed
     *          by double quote and every character is stored in 16 bits i.e. 16-bit UTF (Unicode
     *          Transformation Format) encoding. The String acts the same as an array of characters.
     *          As String is an object so there must be a class behind object and hence it is Java String
     *          class.
     *    Java String class provides a lot of methods to perform operations on strings such as compare(),
     *    concat(), equals(), split(), length(), etc.
     *  E.g: String name = "Java";   String number = "35362"; */
