     * Decision-making statements in Java execute a block of code based on a condition. Decision-making
     * in programming is similar to decision-making in real life.In programming, we want a certain
     * block of code to be executed at some point when the condition becomes true.
     *  These statements are used to control the flow of execution of a program.
     *  Types of Conditional statements: 1. if statement
     *                                   2. if-else
     *                                   3. nested-if or if-under-if statement
     *                                   4. if-else-if or else-if ladder
     *                                   5. switch-case or case control statement */
